The black square above symbolizes a piece of carbon, mostly consisting of C-12 and C-13, but containing some C-14 atoms (yellow dots; initial concentration 10 thousand atoms). Because C-14 is radioactive, as time goes on the C-14 atoms will decay, or in other words disappear. When exactly an individual atom will decay cannot be predicted; it could happen within a few seconds, but it could also survive several tens of thousands of years (the average lifetime is 8033 years). The survival-time of the atoms is modelled through randomly selecting 10,000 values from an exponential distribution with a Libby half-life of 5568 yr (8803*ln(2); red line), and then plotting the remaining atoms for each 50-yr time slice of the animation. It is easy to see that dating of old samples is difficult, as only few C-14 atoms remain. Modern natural carbon contains many more C-14 atoms than the 10 thousand shown here (some 50 million per mg); this number was chosen for illustration purposes only.<p>

It can be downloaded as <a href="mp4/decay.mp4" target="_blank">mp4</a> (good for e.g. presentations) and as <a href="mp4/decay.webm" target="_blank">webm</a> (good for webpages), and is also available on <a href="https://vimeo.com/605461321" target="_blank">vimeo</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/H0B8Docz3IY" target="_blank">youtube</a>. <p>

The R code for this animation can be dowloaded <a href="R_code/C14-decay.R" target="_blank">here</a>. This R script produces lots of .png files, which are then made into an animation (default in .mp4 format, but this can be changed) outside of R. To produce the animation, <a href="https://ffmpeg.org" target="_blank">ffmpeg</a> has to be installed. <p>
