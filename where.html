<h2>Maarten Blaauw's office</h2>

I'm in the ArcPal Building (42 Fitzwilliam Street). Take the righthand set of doors (at the newer part of the building), then go right through the corridor, past the first door, and take the stairs to the first floor. Then turn left, go all along the corridor, then at the end take the stairs back to groundfloor. Go through the doors where it says 'Carbon Dating Facility' and you'll find my door straight on (OG.010). <p>

Of course you can also ask the GAP Office staff to give me a ring and I'll be waiting for you at the lefthand doors of the Arcpal Building. <p>
